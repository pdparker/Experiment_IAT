        <h1>Medical Textbook Images</h1>
        <p>Hi There, <br />
		Once you press next you will be shown a number of images. All these images are taken from medical textbooks used in Australian universities. I would like you to take some time with each picture and think about what part of the textbook these images are taken from, what are they designed to represent, and whether they are similar to images you have seen in your textbooks.</p>
