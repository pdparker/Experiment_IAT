        <p> Dear Participant,<br /><br />
        Welcome to a study on gender representation in anatomy education!
        You have opted to participate in a study on gender representations in anatomy textbook imagery.
        You will complete three tasks:</p>

             <li>View a range of images from anatomy textbooks.</li>
             <li>Complete an <acronym title="Implicit Association Test">IAT</acronym> in which you will sort words into categories as quickly as possible.</li>
             <li>Answer a brief questionnaire. </li>
         </ol> 
        <p>
        You should be able to complete the tasks within 20 minutes. 
        Please note that participation is voluntary and that you can withdraw from the study at any stage. The data collected are confidential and your participation is therefore anonymous.
