<h2>Welcome to the <span class='IATname'></span> IAT</h2>
<!--
<p>You have opted to complete the <span class='IATname'></span> IAT.</p>
-->

<p>In the next task, you will be presented with a set of words to classify into groups. This task requires you to classify items as quickly as you can by pressing the letter “E” or “I” on your keyboard. When the answer calls for a response that matches the group on the left, press the letter “E”. When it calls for a response that matches the group on the right, press the letter “I”. To get the most accurate results, go as fast as you can, even if you make a few mistakes. Going slow can cause the program to reject the results since this does not capture your automatic associations. For maximum speed, place your index fingers on the letters "E" and "I" and your thumbs on the space bar.
This part of the study will take about 5 minutes.</p>
