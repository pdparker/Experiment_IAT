<p><b>Notice above, there are only two categories and they have switched positions.</b> 
The category that was previously on the left is now on the right, and the category that was
on the right is now on the left.  Practice this new configuration.
<br>
Use the <b>E</b> and <b>I</b> keys to categorise left and right, and correct errors 
by hitting the other key.
