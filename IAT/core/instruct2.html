<h1>Welcome to the IAT</h1>
<p>In the next task, you will be presented with a set of words to classify into groups. This task requires you to classify items as quickly as you can by pressing the letter “E” or “I” on your keyboard. When the answer calls for a response that matches the group on the left, press the letter “E”. When it calls for a response that matches the group on the right, press the letter “I”. To get the most accurate results, go as fast as you can, even if you make a few mistakes. Going slow can cause the program to reject the results since this does not capture your automatic associations. For maximum speed, place your index fingers on the letters "E" and "I" and your thumbs on the space bar.</p>
<p>This part of the study will take about 5 minutes. The following is a list of category labels and the items that belong to each of those categories.</p>

<!-- <table>
    <tr><td>Category</td><td>Items</td></tr>
    <tr><td id="clabel1"></td><td id="citems1"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabel2"></td><td id="citems2"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelA"></td><td id="citemsA"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelB"></td><td id="citemsB"></td>
</table> -->

<table>
    <tr><td>Category</td><td>Items</td></tr>
    <tr><td> Repoductive Health</td><td> Fertility, Conception, Sexual, Family, Genitalia, Reproduction</td>
    <tr><td> General Health</td><td> Muscular, Vaccination, Medicine, Cardiovascular, Anatomy, Prescription</td>
    <tr><td> Female</td><td> She, Woman, Her, Girl, Hers, Lady</td>
    <tr><td> Male</td><td> He, Man, Him, Boy, His, Gent</td>
</table>


<p>Keep in mind</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep your index fingers on the 'e' and 'i' keys to enable rapid response.</li>
    <li>Two labels at the top will tell you which words or images go with each key.</li>
    <li>Each word or image has a correct classification. Most of these are easy.</li>
    <li>The test gives no results if you go slow -- <b>Please try to go as fast as possible.</b></li>
    <li>Expect to make a few mistakes because of going fast. That's OK.</li>
    <li>For best results, make sure that your monitor is set to maximum brightness and avoid distractions.</li>
</ul>
